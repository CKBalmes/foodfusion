<h1 align="center">FoodFusion: Recipe Finding Platform</h1>



## Project Overview
    
  Social media platforms, which may connect people worldwide, have been extremely crucial in this modern day in achieving long-distance communication. For common social networks like Facebook and Instagram, the material posted on these channels typically includes a high degree of diversity. If the social network lacks a defined topic, such as food, users who want to search for specific relevant information, such as food recipes, may run into difficulties. Because Facebook isn't designed specifically for recipe finding, users encounter challenges while looking for recipes that only serve one person and take less than twenty minutes to prepare. In addition, individuals now have a harder time finding recipes that they can cook with the ingredients available to them.Therefore, a food recipe finder must be suggested in order to address this issue.
      
  Back when the discovery of the internet was yet to be found, finding new recipes required relying on cookbooks, family recipes, and suggestions from friends. Nevertheless, a large number of recipes are now available online thanks to the internet. Although a large number of recipes are now available online thanks to the internet there is no centralized platform for finding recipes. Recipe finding is a feature that may be very beneficial and interesting for users who are interested in cooking since it allows users to learn how to make food and learnÂ  in a more efficient and timely manner via the use of recipes that are given by the platform based on the user's input of ingredients.

By making it possible for users to find recipes, encourage them to use locally sourced, seasonally appropriate ingredients, reduce food waste, and promote sustainable cooking methods, the design and development of a recipe sharing platform that is dependable and effective, that can help the world's developing nations (SDGs) 3 and 12 be achieved.


 
## Significance of the Project
    
  This project on creating a recipe finding platform will have a big influence on encouraging healthy eating and cross-cultural interaction. The creation of a  recipe finding platform can provide an area for food bloggers, home cooks and cooking aficionados to find recipes that they can cook. The area of food and recipe finding may be considerably impacted by this study and can make significant contributions by gaining insights into how users interact with the platform, how they find recipes  and how the platforms can be improved. The creation of a collaborative platform for finding recipes can support and advance sustainable development goals (SDG) 3 and 12. 
  
  It can help advance Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 3 and 12, which aim to increase access to healthy food by educating people about nutrition and fostering cross-cultural interaction by enabling them to find recipes and culinary customs from various cultures while also promoting sustainable consumption  to use foods that might otherwise go to waste.
